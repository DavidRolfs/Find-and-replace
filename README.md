# Find And Replace C# Project

#### Written by David and Hunter

###### Description
This program is designed to have a user input a sentence, a word they want to replace in that sentence, and another word they want to replace that word with. The program will then run through a method that will change the sentence into an array and split up each word into a section into that array. The program will then replace the word the user selected with another word they have inputted. The program will change the array back into a string and display their new array.
